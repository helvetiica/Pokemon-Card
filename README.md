# 3D Pokemon Card using SwiftUI

A fun little project to demonstrate the implementation of a parallax effect on one of my favorite Pokemon cards using SwiftUI ðŸ’–

## Features

- Parallax Effect: Utilizes SwiftUI animations to create a parallax effect on the Charizard card.
- Modular Design: The code is organized in a modular and reusable manner, making it easy to integrate the parallax effect into other SwiftUI projects.
- Customizable: Easily customize the Pokemon card by updating the content and images _(cardbg.png & charizard.png)_ with your favorite Pokemon.
